        "#### Q1: Explain what is Anomaly Detection? ⭐\n",
        "##### Answer:\n",
        "**Anomaly detection** (or outlier detection) is the identification of rare items, events or observations which raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of the data.\n",

        "\n",
        "#### Q2: Why do we care about Anomalies? ⭐⭐\n",
        "##### Answer:\n",
        "* The goal of anomaly detection is to identify cases that are unusual within data that is seemingly comparable hence anomaly detection can be used effectively as a tool for risk mitigation and fraud detection.\n",
        "* When preparing datasets for machine learning models, it is really important to detect all the outliers and either get rid of them or analyze them to know why you had them there in the first place.\n",

        "\n",
        "#### Q3: What's the difference between _Normalisation_ and _Standardisation_? ⭐⭐\n",
        "##### Answer:\n",
        "**Normalization** rescales the values into a range of \\[0,1\\].  This might be useful in some cases where all parameters need to have the same positive scale. However, the _outliers_ from the data set _are lost._\n",

        "##### Answer:\n",
        "The **Median** is the most suitable measure of _central tendency_ for **skewed distributions** or distributions with **outliers**. For example, the median is often used as a measure of central tendency for income distributions, which are generally highly skewed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Because the median only uses one or two values, it’s unaffected by extreme _outliers_ or _non-symmetric distributions_ of scores. In contrast, the **_mean_** and **_mode_** can vary in skewed distributions.\n",

        "In supervised machine learning an algorithm learns a model from training data.\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal of any supervised machine learning algorithm is to best estimate the mapping function (f) for the output variable (Y) given the input data (X). The mapping function is often called the target function because it is the function that a given supervised machine learning algorithm aims to approximate.\n",

        "##### Answer:\n",
        "**Big-O** notation (also called \"asymptotic growth\" notation) is a relative representation of the complexity of an algorithm. It shows how an algorithm *scales* based on input size. We use it to talk about how thing _scale_. Big O complexity can be visualized with this graph:\n",

        "##### Answer:\n",
        "Big-O is often used to make statements about functions that measure the worst case behavior of an algorithm. **Worst case** analysis gives the maximum number of basic operations that have to be performed during execution of the algorithm. It assumes that the input is in the _worst possible state_ and maximum work has to be done to put things right.\n",

        "**Source:** _stackoverflow.com_\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Q4: What the heck does it mean if an operation is <code><i>O</i>(<i>log n</i>)</code>? ⭐⭐\n",
        "##### Answer:\n",
        "**<code><i>O</i>(<i>log n</i>)</code>** means for every element, you're doing something that only needs to look at **log N** of the elements. This is usually because you know something about the elements that let you make an _efficient choice_ (for example to reduce a _search space_).\n",
        "The most common attributes of logarithmic running\\-time function are that:\n",
        "*   the choice of the next element on which to perform some action is one of several possibilities, and\n",

        "\n",
        "*   the elements on which the action is performed are digits of `n`\n",
        "\n",
        "Most efficient sorts are an example of this, such as **merge sort**. ​It is `O(log n)` when we do divide and conquer type of algorithms e.g binary search. Another example is **quick sort** where each time we divide the array into two parts and each time it takes `O(N)` time to find a pivot element. Hence it `N O(log N)`\n",

        "#### Q5: Why do we use Big O notation to compare algorithms?  ⭐⭐\n",
        "##### Answer:\n",
        "The fact is it's difficult to determine the exact runtime of an algorithm. It depends on the speed of the computer processor. So instead of talking about the runtime directly, we use Big O Notation to talk about _how quickly the runtime grows_ depending on input size.\n",
        "\n",
        "With Big O Notation, we use the size of the input, which we call `n`. So we can say things like the runtime grows “on the order of the size of the input” (<code><i>O</i>(<i>n</i>)</code>) or “on the order of the square of the size of the input” (<code><i>O</i>(<i>n</i><sup>2</sup>)</code>). Our algorithm may have steps that seem expensive when `n` is small but are eclipsed eventually by other steps as `n` gets larger. For Big O Notation analysis, we care more about the stuff that grows fastest as the input grows, because everything else is quickly eclipsed as `n` gets very large.\n",

        "* In this clustering paradigm, the points to be clustered are not assumed to be part of a vector space. Their attributes (or features) are incorporated into a single dimension, the *link strength*, or *similarity*, which takes a numerical value $$S_{ij}$$ for each pair of points `i`, `j`. Hence, the natural representation for this problem is by means of the similarity matrix given below:\n",

A **priority queue** is different from a \"normal\" queue, because instead of being a \"first-in-first-out\" data structure, values come out in order by **priority**.

        "##### Answer:\n",
        "- **_K-nearest neighbors_** or _KNN_ is a _supervised classification algorithm_. This means that we need labeled data to classify an unlabeled data point. It attempts to classify a data point based on its proximity to other `K`-data points in the feature space.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **_K-means Clustering_** is an _unsupervised classification algorithm_. It requires only a set of unlabeled points and a threshold `K`, so it gathers and groups data into `K` number of clusters.\n",

        "* Clustering, when the data are similar pairs of points is called **similarity-based clustering**.\n",
        "* A typical example of similarity-based clustering is community detection in social networks, where the observations are individual links between people, which may be due to friendship, shared interests, and work relationships. The *strength* of a link can be the frequency of interactions, for example, communications by e-mail, phone, or other social media, co-authorships, or citations.\n",
        "* In this clustering paradigm, the points to be clustered are not assumed to be part of a vector space. Their attributes (or features) are incorporated into a single dimension, the *link strength*, or *similarity*, which takes a numerical value $$S_{ij}$$ for each pair of points `i`, `j`. Hence, the natural representation for this problem is by means of the similarity matrix given below:\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **R-squared**: It is a statistical measure of how close the data points are to the fitted regression line. Its value is always between `0` and `1`. The closer to `1`, the better the regression model fits the observations.\n",

        "##### Answer:\n",
        "**Logistic regression** can be used in _classification_ problems where the output or dependent variable is _categorical_ or _binary_. However, in order to implement logistic regression correctly, the dataset must also satisfy the following properties:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. There should not be a high correlation between the independent variables. In other words, the predictor variables should be independent of each other.\n",
        "2. There should be a linear relationship between the `logit` of the outcome and each predictor variable. The `logit` function is given as `logit(p) = log(p/(1-p))`, where `p` is the probability of the outcome.\n",
        "3. The sample size must be large. How large depends on the number of independent variables of the model.\n",

        "Although the task we are targeting in logistic regression is a classification, _logistic regression does not actually individually classify things for you_: it just gives you probabilities (or log odds ratios in the logit form).\n",
        "\n",
        "The only way logistic regression can actually classify stuff is if you apply a rule to the probability output. For example, you may round probabilities greater than or equal to `50%` to `1`, and probabilities less than `50%` to `0`, and that’s your classification.\n",

        "* **Overfitting** happens when a model learns the detail and noise in the training data to the extent that it negatively impacts the performance of the model on new data. This means that the noise or random fluctuations in the training data is picked up and learned as concepts by the model. The problem is that these concepts do not apply to new data and negatively impact the model's ability to generalize.\n",

        "*   Python is well suited to **object orientated programming** in that it allows the definition of classes along with composition and inheritance. Python does not have access specifiers (like C++'s `public`, `private`), the justification for this point is given as \"we are all adults here\"\n",
        "*   In Python, **functions are first-class objects**. This means that they can be assigned to variables, returned from other functions and passed into functions. Classes are also first class objects\n",
        "*   Writing Python code is quick but running it is **often slower than compiled languages**. Fortunately, Python allows the inclusion of C based extensions so bottlenecks can be optimised away and often are. The `numpy` package is a good example of this, it's really quite quick because a lot of the number crunching it does isn't actually done by Python\n",

If the number of input features is 3, then the hyperplane becomes a two-dimensional plane.\n",

        "**Linear (sequential) search** goes through all possible elements in some array and compare each one with the desired element. It may take up to <code><i>O</i>(<i>n</i>)</code> operations, where N is the size of an array and is widely considered to be horribly slow. In linear search when you perform one operation you reduce the size of the problem _by one_ (when you do one operation in binary search you reduce the size of the problem _by half_). Despite it, it can still be used when:\n",
        "\n",
        "* You need to perform this search only once,\n",
        "* You are _forbidden_ to rearrange the elements and you do not have any extra memory,\n",
        "* The array is tiny, such as ten elements or less, or the performance is not an issue at all,\n",
        "* Even though in theory other search algorithms may be faster than linear search (for instance binary search), in practice even on medium-sized arrays (around 100 items or less) it might be infeasible to use anything else. On larger arrays, it only makes sense to use other, faster search methods if the data is large enough, because the initial time to prepare (sort) the data is comparable to many linear searches,\n",
        "* When the list items are arranged in order of _decreasing probability_, and these probabilities are geometrically distributed, the cost of linear search is only <code><i>O</i>(<i>1</i>)</code>\n",
        "* You have no idea what you are searching.\n",
        "\n",
        "When you ask MySQL something like `SELECT x FROM y WHERE z = t`, and `z` is a column _without_ an index, linear search is performed with all the consequences of it. This is why adding an index to _searchable_ columns is important.\n",

This would work by clustering all the data points and then applying the labels from the labeled ones to the unlabeled ones.\n",

When this happens, the algorithm is memorizing the training data rather than learning how to generalize the knowledge of the training data. Unsupervised learning can be introduced as a *regularizer*. *Regularization* is a process that helps to reduce the complexity of a machine learning algorithm, helping it capture the signal in the data without adjusting too much to the noise.\n",

If machine learning algorithms train on outliers (rare cases) then their generalization error will be lower than if they are ignored. *Unsupervised learning* can perform outlier detection using *dimensionality reduction* and create solutions specifically for the outliers, and separately, a solution for the normal data.\n",
