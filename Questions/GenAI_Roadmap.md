*   **Generative AI (GenAI)**
    *   **Definition & Core Capability**
        *   **Creates new content** like text, images, music, or code.
        *   Learns patterns from existing data and **mimics human creativity**.
        *   Historically, machine learning (ML) was not used for problems requiring human creativity, but GenAI changed this.
        *   Considered GenAI's "biggest superpower".
    *   **Place in AI Landscape**
        *   AI (outer circle) → Machine Learning (ML) → Deep Learning (DL) → Generative AI (innermost, originated from advancements in DL like Transformer architecture).
    *   **Key Impact Areas**
        *   **Customer Support**: Helps companies manage large volumes of queries and complaints, reducing reliance on costly human call centres. Companies like Zomato implement **first layer chatbots powered by GenAI** to handle customer support, reducing the need for human executives.
        *   **Content Creation**: Heavily penetrated this field, assisting in creating text-based (blogs, websites) and video-based content. Output quality is so high, it's hard to distinguish human vs. AI-generated content.
        *   **Education**: Tools like ChatGPT have transformed learning by acting as a **personal tutor**, making it easier to plan curriculums, get unstuck, or find practice questions. Led to evolution in educational methodologies.
        *   **Software Development**: Aids in writing **production-ready code**, simplifying programming. Tasks that previously required five programmers might now be handled by two or three with AI tools.
    *   **Success as a Technology**
        *   Assessed by comparing to successful Internet and less successful Blockchain/Crypto.
        *   **Series of Questions (Answered "Yes" for GenAI):**
            *   **Solves Real-World Problems?**
                *   E.g., large-scale customer handling for companies, accessible personal tutors in education.
            *   **Useful on a Daily Basis?**
            *   **Impacting World Economy?**
                *   E.g., a new Chinese AI model (DeepSeek-R1) caused a **$1 trillion wipeout in US-based tech company stock shares** upon market entry.
            *   **Creating New Jobs?**
                *   Led to a **completely new job role: AI Engineer**. Demand is increasing daily, projected to be as popular as software/web developer jobs in 5 years.
            *   **Accessible?**
                *   Tools are highly accessible for non-technical users (e.g., parents) as they don't require coding; users interact by speaking in English or Hindi.
        *   **Conclusion**: GenAI is on the path to success, similar to the Internet, and is a worthwhile area for investment of time and effort.
    *   **Challenges in Learning/Teaching GenAI**
        *   **Fast-Paced Evolution**: New models, research papers, tools, and terminology emerge daily, making curriculum planning difficult.
        *   **Information Overload & Noise**: Constant "FOMO" (Fear Of Missing Out) environment.
        *   **Lack of Established Single Source/Curriculum**: New technology, so no consolidated learning path yet.
    *   **Mental Model for Understanding GenAI: Foundation Models (FM)**
        *   **Core Concept**: FMs are at the centre of the GenAI landscape.
        *   **Definition**: Very large-scale AI models trained on huge amounts of data (e.g., entire internet) and extensive hardware (GPUs), costing millions.
        *   **Key Feature: Generalised Models**: Unlike task-specific machine learning models, FMs can solve multiple tasks.
            *   Example: LLMs (Large Language Models) like those that are the backbone of GenAI, can do text generation, sentiment analysis, summarisation, Q&A.
            *   Also includes LMMs (Large Multimodal Models) that work with images, videos, sound, not just text.
        *   **Two Core Perspectives/Tasks in GenAI**
            *   **1. User Perspective (Application Building)**
                *   **Goal**: Using pre-built Foundation Models for specific applications.
                *   **Curriculum (Less Technical, Easier)**:
                    *   **Basic LLM Applications**: Using different types of LLMs (closed/open source), APIs, tools like Hugging Face and Ollama, and frameworks like LangChain.
                    *   **Improving LLM Responses**:
                        *   **Prompt Engineering**: Art and science of writing prompts to refine LLM output.
                        *   **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: Enabling LLMs to answer questions using private/personal data.
                        *   **Fine-tuning**: Shallow-level fine-tuning of models for specific needs.
                    *   **AI Agents**: Building LLM-powered software that not only chats but also performs actions (e.g., booking tickets), by providing LLMs with tools.
                    *   **LLM Ops**: Deployment, evaluation, and technical handling of LLM-based applications.
                    *   **Miscellaneous**: Multi-modal FMs (e.g., audio/video inputs/outputs), Stable Diffusion/Diffusion models.
                *   **Who it's for**: Anyone with some software development knowledge can do 80-85% of the work.
            *   **2. Builder Perspective (Building Foundation Models)**
                *   **Goal**: Creating and deploying Foundation Models for others to use.
                *   **Curriculum (More Technical, Requires ML/DL Fundamentals, PyTorch/TensorFlow)**:
                    *   **Transformer Architecture**: Understanding encoders, decoders, embeddings, self-attention, layer normalisation, language modelling.
                    *   **Types of Transformers**: Encoder-only (e.g., BERT), Decoder-only (e.g., GPT), Encoder-Decoder.
                    *   **Pre-training**: Training objectives, tokenisation strategies, training methods (distributed training), challenges and solutions, evaluation.
                    *   **Optimisation**: Techniques to run large FMs on normal hardware, including compression, **quantisation**, knowledge distillation, and inference time reduction.
                    *   **Fine-tuning**: Task-specific tuning, instruction tuning, continual pre-training, **RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback)**, PeFT.
                    *   **Evaluation**: Thorough evaluation techniques using different metrics to assess performance (e.g., LLM leaderboards).
                    *   **Deployment**: Final step to make models accessible.
                *   **Who it's for**: Research Scientists, Data Scientists, ML Engineers.
            *   **AI Engineer Role**: Requires knowledge of **both** User and Builder perspectives for better salary and operational ability.
    *   **CampusX Learning Strategy (for GenAI)**
        *   **Parallel Coverage**: Will cover both Builder and User sides simultaneously.
        *   **Modular Playlists**: Instead of one large playlist, will create small, dedicated playlists for each module/topic.
        *   **No Paid Course (Currently)**: Instructor feels he hasn't 100% mastered the technology yet, prioritising free content on YouTube for wider audience feedback and self-improvement.
        *   **Timeframe**: Estimated to take the entire year (2024) to cover the curriculum, with 2-3 videos per week.
        *   **Goal**: Instructor aims to deeply understand and master the technology to become an expert.
