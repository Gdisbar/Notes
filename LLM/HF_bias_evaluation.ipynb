        "\n",
        "## Core Evaluation Metrics\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Metrics to Remember:\n",
        "1. **Answer Relevancy**: Determines if the LLM output addresses the input concisely and informatively\n",
        "2. **Prompt Alignment**: Checks if the output follows the given prompt instructions\n",
        "3. **Correctness**: Verifies factual accuracy against ground truth\n",
        "4. **Hallucination**: Identifies fabricated or made-up information\n",
        "5. **Contextual Relevancy**: Assesses the relevance of retrieved context in RAG systems\n",
        "\n",
        "## Scoring Methods: What Really Matters\n",
        "\n",
        "### Best Scoring Approaches:\n",
        "- **LLM-based Scorers > Statistical Scorers**\n",
        "- Avoid purely statistical methods (BLEU, ROUGE) as they lack semantic understanding\n",
        "- Prefer methods that leverage LLM reasoning capabilities\n",
        "\n",
        "### Top Evaluation Techniques:\n",
        "1. **G-Eval**:\n",
        "   - Uses LLMs to generate evaluation steps\n",
        "   - Generates scores with reasoning\n",
        "   - Flexible for various evaluation criteria\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **QAG (Question Answer Generation) Score**:\n",
        "   - Leverages LLM reasoning without direct score generation\n",
        "   - Uses close-ended questions to compute metrics\n",
        "   - Most reliable for clear evaluation objectives\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **DAG (Deep Acyclic Graph)**:\n",
        "   - Decision tree powered by LLM judgments\n",
        "   - Deterministic scoring for specific use cases\n",
        "   - Breaks evaluation into fine-grained steps\n",
        "\n",
        "## RAG Metrics to Focus On\n",
        "- **Faithfulness**: Alignment of output with retrieval context\n",
        "- **Answer Relevancy**: Conciseness and input-relevance of answers\n",
        "- **Contextual Precision**: Quality of retrieved context ranking\n",
        "- **Contextual Recall**: Proportion of expected output found in context\n",
        "\n",
        "## Fine-Tuning Metrics\n",
        "- **Hallucination Detection**: Identify fabricated information\n",
        "- **Toxicity**: Evaluate harmful or inappropriate language\n",
        "- **Bias**: Assess potential discriminatory content\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Principles for Great Metrics\n",
        "1. **Quantitative**: Compute numeric scores\n",
        "2. **Reliable**: Consistent evaluation\n",
        "3. **Accurate**: Align with human expectations\n",
        "\n",
        "## Practical Takeaway\n",
        "The best metrics:\n",
        "- Use LLM reasoning\n",
        "- Are use-case specific\n",
        "- Provide transparent scoring with explanations\n",
