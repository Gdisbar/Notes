    "# LLM Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Metrics to Remember:\n",
    "1. **Answer Relevancy**: Determines if the LLM output addresses the input concisely and informatively\n",
    "2. **Prompt Alignment**: Checks if the output follows the given prompt instructions\n",
    "3. **Correctness**: Verifies factual accuracy against ground truth\n",
    "4. **Hallucination**: Identifies fabricated or made-up information\n",
    "5. **Contextual Relevancy**: Assesses the relevance of retrieved context in RAG systems\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scoring Methods: What Really Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Scoring Approaches:\n",
    "- **LLM-based Scorers > Statistical Scorers**\n",
    "- Avoid purely statistical methods (BLEU, ROUGE) as they lack semantic understanding\n",
    "- Prefer methods that leverage LLM reasoning capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "### Top Evaluation Techniques:\n",
    "1. **G-Eval**:\n",
    "   - Uses LLMs to generate evaluation steps\n",
    "   - Generates scores with reasoning\n",
    "   - Flexible for various evaluation criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **QAG (Question Answer Generation) Score**:\n",
    "   - Leverages LLM reasoning without direct score generation\n",
    "   - Uses close-ended questions to compute metrics\n",
    "   - Most reliable for clear evaluation objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **DAG (Deep Acyclic Graph)**:\n",
    "   - Decision tree powered by LLM judgments\n",
    "   - Deterministic scoring for specific use cases\n",
    "   - Breaks evaluation into fine-grained steps\n",
    "\n",
    "## RAG Metrics to Focus On\n",
    "- **Faithfulness**: Alignment of output with retrieval context\n",
    "- **Answer Relevancy**: Conciseness and input-relevance of answers\n",
    "- **Contextual Precision**: Quality of retrieved context ranking\n",
    "- **Contextual Recall**: Proportion of expected output found in context\n",
    "\n",
    "## Fine-Tuning Metrics\n",
    "- **Hallucination Detection**: Identify fabricated information\n",
    "- **Toxicity**: Evaluate harmful or inappropriate language\n",
    "- **Bias**: Assess potential discriminatory content\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Principles for Great Metrics\n",
    "1. **Quantitative**: Compute numeric scores\n",
    "2. **Reliable**: Consistent evaluation\n",
    "3. **Accurate**: Align with human expectations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical Takeaway\n",
    "The best metrics:\n",
    "- Use LLM reasoning\n",
    "- Are use-case specific\n",
    "- Provide transparent scoring with explanations\n",
    "\n",
